        <p class="help" > Hashing is a process of taking a string of any length and converting 
          it into a fixed length string that represents the original string. It is a one-way process,  meaning that it is not possible to reverse the process and get the original string back. 
           Hashing is used for security purposes, such as storing passwords,  as it is not possible to reverse the process and get the original password back. </p></div>
